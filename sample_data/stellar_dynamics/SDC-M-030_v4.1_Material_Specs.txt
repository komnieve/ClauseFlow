v4.1    2024-06-18   Revised heat treatment requirements for aluminum
                     alloys, updated approved source list

================================================================================
                    1.0 APPROVED MATERIAL SOURCES
================================================================================

1.1 All metallic raw materials used in SDC hardware shall be procured
from sources listed on the SDC Approved Material Supplier List (AMSL),
maintained by SDC Materials Engineering.

1.2 Approved sources include Original Material Manufacturers (OMM) and
authorized distributors verified by SDC. Independent distributors or
brokers are not approved sources unless specifically authorized in
writing by SDC Materials Engineering.

1.3 Material substitutions, including alternate alloy tempers or
equivalent specifications, require prior written approval from SDC
Engineering via a Material Substitution Request (MSR).

1.4 The supplier shall flow down approved source requirements to all
sub-tier suppliers performing material procurement for SDC hardware.

================================================================================
           2.0 MATERIAL CERTIFICATION AND TRACEABILITY
================================================================================

2.1 All metallic materials shall be accompanied by Certified Mill Test
Reports (CMTR) conforming to the applicable material specification
(e.g., AMS, ASTM, SAE). Each CMTR shall include as a minimum:
    (a) Material specification and grade/alloy designation
    (b) Heat or lot number
    (c) Chemical composition (actual values)
    (d) Mechanical properties (actual test values)
    (e) Heat treatment condition or temper
    (f) Dimensional verification results

2.2 Material traceability shall be maintained from raw material receipt
through finished part delivery. Each part or lot shall be traceable to
the original material heat or lot number.

2.3 Material identification markings (stamps, etch, vibro-peen) shall
be maintained on all parts through final processing unless removal is
required by the drawing. Marking methods shall not introduce stress
concentrations or surface damage.

2.4 Electronic material traceability records shall be maintained for a
minimum of fifteen (15) years from the date of part delivery and shall
be provided to SDC upon request.

================================================================================
                 3.0 HEAT TREATMENT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

3.1 All heat treatment operations shall be performed by processors
accredited by Nadcap for the applicable heat treatment processes and
material types.

3.2 Heat treatment shall be performed per the applicable material
specification or the process specification callout on the SDC drawing.
Commonly referenced specifications include:
    (a) AMS 2750 — Pyrometry (furnace classification and surveys)
    (b) AMS 2770 — Heat Treatment of Aluminum Alloy Parts
    (c) AMS 2774 — Heat Treatment of Nickel Alloy Parts
    (d) AMS-H-6875 — Heat Treatment of Steel

3.3 Furnace equipment used for heat treatment shall be surveyed per
AMS 2750 at the required intervals. Current furnace survey records
shall be available for review by SDC Quality Assurance.

3.4 Heat treatment records shall include furnace identification,
load identification, time-temperature charts, and quench data as
applicable. These records shall be retained and traceable to the
delivered parts.

================================================================================
                4.0 SURFACE FINISH REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

4.1 Surface finishes and protective coatings shall be applied per the
SDC drawing callout. All surface treatment processes shall be performed
by Nadcap-accredited processors for the applicable process.

4.2 Common surface finish specifications referenced on SDC drawings:
    (a) AMS 2404 — Electroless Nickel Plating
    (b) AMS 2405 — Chemical Film (Chromate Conversion Coating)
    (c) MIL-A-8625 — Anodic Coating (Anodizing) of Aluminum
    (d) AMS 2411 — Cadmium Plating (where permitted)
    (e) ASTM B633 — Zinc Plating
    (f) AMS 2430 — Shot Peening

4.3 Surface roughness shall not exceed the values specified on the
drawing. Where no surface roughness is specified, the default maximum
shall be 125 microinches Ra for machined surfaces.

4.4 Parts shall be free of burrs, sharp edges, tool marks, and other
surface defects that could affect form, fit, or function. Edge break
requirements shall be per the drawing or 0.005-0.015 inch if not
specified.

================================================================================
                   5.0 PROHIBITED MATERIALS
================================================================================

5.1 The following materials and substances are prohibited from use in
SDC flight hardware unless a specific waiver is granted by SDC
Materials Engineering:
    (a) Cadmium and cadmium compounds (except where specified on
        legacy drawings with approved cadmium plating callouts)
    (b) Hexavalent chromium compounds
    (c) Mercury and mercury compounds
    (d) Asbestos-containing materials
    (e) Beryllium and beryllium-copper alloys (except approved
        electrical contacts and springs)
    (f) Lead and lead compounds (except as exempted under aerospace
        RoHS provisions)
    (g) Zinc-plated fasteners in contact with aluminum structure

5.2 Material declarations shall be provided when requested by SDC
Procurement, identifying any substances of concern per EU REACH
Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 Candidate List.

5.3 The supplier shall notify SDC immediately if any prohibited
material is discovered in delivered or in-process hardware.

================================================================================
                    6.0 SHELF-LIFE CONTROLS
================================================================================

6.1 Materials with defined shelf-life limitations shall be stored,
handled, and controlled per the manufacturer's requirements and the
applicable material specification.

6.2 The following material categories are subject to shelf-life
control:
    (a) Adhesives and sealants
    (b) Primer and paint coatings
    (c) Pre-impregnated composite materials (prepreg)
    (d) Chemical processing solutions (etchants, plating baths)
    (e) Faying surface sealants and shim materials
    (f) Age-sensitive elastomeric seals and O-rings

6.3 Materials shall be used before their expiration date. Extension
of shelf life requires documented testing and approval per the
applicable SDC shelf-life extension procedure.

6.4 Storage conditions (temperature, humidity) shall be monitored and
recorded for all shelf-life controlled materials. Records shall be
available for review during SDC quality audits.
