================================================================================

Rev A   2019-03-15   Initial Release
Rev B   2021-08-22   Updated sampling plans, added NDT hold points
Rev C   2024-09-12   Added digital documentation requirements, revised
                     acceptance criteria for Flight Critical assemblies

================================================================================
                       1.0 SCOPE AND PURPOSE
================================================================================

1.1 This specification establishes the requirements for source inspection
and receiving inspection of materials, parts, components, and assemblies
procured by Stellar Dynamics Corporation (SDC) from external suppliers.

1.2 These requirements apply to all purchase orders issued by SDC that
reference this specification, including subcontracted items and services
performed at supplier facilities.

1.3 The intent of this specification is to ensure that all delivered
products conform to purchase order requirements prior to acceptance into
SDC inventory and integration into flight hardware.

================================================================================
                      2.0 APPLICABILITY
================================================================================

2.1 This specification applies to all suppliers providing hardware,
materials, or assemblies to SDC under any purchase order or subcontract.

2.2 The level of source inspection required shall be determined by the
criticality classification assigned to each line item:
    (a) Flight Critical: Mandatory source inspection per Section 4.0
    (b) Mission Essential: Source inspection at SDC discretion
    (c) Standard: Receiving inspection only, per Section 5.0

2.3 Government source inspection (GSI) may be imposed in addition to
SDC source inspection when required by the prime contract or regulatory
authority.

================================================================================
                 3.0 SOURCE INSPECTOR ACCESS
================================================================================

3.1 The supplier shall grant SDC quality representatives and authorized
government inspectors unrestricted access to all facilities, processes,
and records relevant to the purchase order.

3.2 Access shall be provided with a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours
advance notice, except in cases of urgent quality concerns where
twenty-four (24) hour notice may be given.

3.3 The supplier shall provide a dedicated workspace, lighting, and
inspection equipment as reasonably necessary for the source inspector
to perform required inspections and reviews.

3.4 Source inspection by SDC does not relieve the supplier of the
responsibility to perform its own quality inspections and deliver
conforming product.

================================================================================
              4.0 DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

4.1 The supplier shall prepare and maintain a complete documentation
package for each shipment, which shall include as applicable:
    (a) Certificate of Conformance (CoC) signed by an authorized
        quality representative
    (b) First Article Inspection Reports per AS9102 (when required)
    (c) Dimensional inspection reports with actual measured values
    (d) Material certifications traceable to the original mill or
        material manufacturer
    (e) Special process certifications (heat treat, plating, NDT, etc.)
    (f) Functional and environmental test data

4.2 All documentation shall be submitted electronically via the SDC
Supplier Quality Portal unless otherwise directed. Hard copies shall
accompany the shipment when specified on the purchase order.

4.3 Documentation shall be retained by the supplier for a minimum of
fifteen (15) years from the date of final delivery.

================================================================================
                       5.0 HOLD POINTS
================================================================================

5.1 The following are mandatory hold points requiring SDC source
inspector witness or approval before the supplier may proceed:
    (a) First Article Inspection — prior to production release
    (b) Final acceptance testing — prior to packaging for shipment
    (c) Any nondestructive testing (NDT) specified on the drawing
    (d) Special process verification (e.g., torque, bonding, potting)

5.2 The supplier shall notify SDC Quality Assurance a minimum of five
(5) business days prior to each hold point to allow scheduling of
source inspection personnel.

5.3 Work beyond a hold point without source inspector authorization
shall be cause for rejection of the affected units.

================================================================================
                      6.0 SAMPLING PLANS
================================================================================

6.1 Unless otherwise specified on the purchase order or drawing,
inspection sampling shall be performed in accordance with
ANSI/ASQ Z1.4 (Inspection by Attributes) using the following:
    (a) Flight Critical items: AQL 0.65, Inspection Level II
    (b) Mission Essential items: AQL 1.0, Inspection Level II
    (c) Standard items: AQL 2.5, Inspection Level I

6.2 For characteristics designated as Critical or Major on the
engineering drawing, 100% inspection is required regardless of the
sampling plan.

6.3 Variables data sampling, when applicable, shall be performed per
ANSI/ASQ Z1.9 at the corresponding AQL levels.

================================================================================
                 7.0 NONCONFORMANCE REPORTING
================================================================================

7.1 Any nonconformance discovered during source or receiving inspection
shall be documented on an SDC Supplier Nonconformance Report (SNCR).

7.2 The supplier shall not ship nonconforming material without a
written disposition from SDC. Acceptable dispositions include:
    (a) Return to supplier for rework
    (b) Return to supplier for replacement
    (c) Use-as-is (requires SDC engineering approval and MRB action)
    (d) Repair (requires SDC engineering approval of repair procedure)
    (e) Scrap

7.3 The supplier shall submit a root cause analysis and corrective
action plan within ten (10) business days of nonconformance notification.

7.4 Recurring nonconformances of the same type may result in escalated
source inspection, placement on the SDC Supplier Watch List, or removal
from the Approved Supplier List.

================================================================================
                 8.0 FINAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
================================================================================

8.1 Final acceptance of delivered product requires all of the following:
    (a) All purchase order requirements are met, including drawing
        dimensions, material specifications, and performance criteria
    (b) All required documentation is complete and accurate
    (c) All hold point verifications are satisfactorily completed
    (d) No open nonconformance reports exist against the shipment
    (e) Packaging and preservation meet purchase order requirements

8.2 For Flight Critical assemblies, final acceptance additionally
requires:
    (a) Successful completion of all functional tests per the
        applicable test procedure
    (b) Verification of serialization and traceability markings
    (c) SDC source inspector sign-off on the acceptance documentation
    (d) Completion of the SDC Acceptance Data Package checklist

8.3 Acceptance of product by SDC receiving inspection does not waive
any warranty or contractual rights. Latent defects discovered after
acceptance shall be subject to the warranty provisions of the
purchase order.
