                          REVISION HISTORY
================================================================================

Rev A   2024-03-05   Initial Release — derived from legacy WHS-400 series
                     and updated for current platform requirements

================================================================================
                       1.0 WIRE TYPES AND GAUGES
================================================================================

1.1 All wiring used in SDC flight hardware shall be selected from the
SDC Approved Wire List maintained in the SDC Materials Database.

1.2 The following wire types are approved for use:
    (a) M22759/32 — Tin-coated copper, extruded ETFE insulation
    (b) M22759/34 — Nickel-coated copper, extruded ETFE insulation
    (c) M22759/43 — Tin-coated copper, crosslinked ETFE insulation
    (d) M22759/44 — Nickel-coated copper, crosslinked ETFE insulation

1.3 Wire gauge selection shall be per the applicable SDC wiring diagram.
Minimum gauge for power circuits shall be 22 AWG. Minimum gauge for
signal circuits shall be 26 AWG unless otherwise specified.

1.4 Wire derating shall comply with SAE AS50881 for the applicable
installation environment (ambient temperature, altitude, bundle size).

================================================================================
                 2.0 CONNECTOR TERMINATION CRITERIA
================================================================================

2.1 All crimped terminations shall be performed using calibrated tools
listed on the contact manufacturer's qualified tool list.

2.2 Crimp quality shall meet the requirements of SAE AS7928 (formerly
MIL-STD-1722) for the applicable contact type and wire size combination.

2.3 Pull test requirements:
    (a) Destructive pull testing shall be performed on the first and
        last termination of each wire gauge per work shift
    (b) Minimum pull test values per NASA-STD-8739.4, Table 1
    (c) Any pull test failure requires 100% re-inspection of all
        terminations made since the last successful test

2.4 Solder terminations, where permitted by drawing, shall meet
IPC J-STD-001 Class 3 with Space Addendum requirements.

2.5 Contact insertion into connector shells shall be verified by a
retention test (tug test) of minimum 1 lb force applied axially.

================================================================================
                 3.0 HARNESS ROUTING REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

3.1 Wire harness routing shall conform to the harness drawing and
routing diagram. Deviations from the specified routing require SDC
engineering approval via an Engineering Change Request.

3.2 Minimum bend radius shall be six (6) times the outer diameter of
the harness bundle, or as specified on the drawing, whichever is
greater.

3.3 Harness supports and clamps shall be installed at intervals not
exceeding twenty-four (24) inches, or per the installation drawing.

3.4 Harnesses shall be protected from chafing at all points of contact
with structure using approved sleeving, grommets, or edge protection.

3.5 Separation requirements between wire categories:
    (a) Minimum 2 inches between power and signal wiring
    (b) Minimum 4 inches between high-voltage (>50V) and low-level
        signal wiring
    (c) Shielded cables shall be used where separation cannot be
        maintained

================================================================================
             4.0 CONTINUITY AND HIPOT TESTING
================================================================================

4.1 Every completed wire harness shall undergo 100% continuity testing
to verify correct point-to-point wiring per the harness schematic.

4.2 Insulation resistance testing (hipot) shall be performed on all
completed harnesses:
    (a) Test voltage: 500 VDC minimum (or as specified on the drawing)
    (b) Minimum insulation resistance: 100 megohms at 500 VDC
    (c) Dwell time: minimum 60 seconds
    (d) Test between each conductor and all other conductors tied
        together, and between each conductor and the shield/structure

4.3 Test equipment shall be calibrated and traceable to NIST standards.
Calibration records shall be available for review during source
inspection.

4.4 All test results shall be recorded and included in the deliverable
data package. Failures shall be documented and dispositioned per the
applicable nonconformance process.

================================================================================
                   5.0 LABELING AND MARKING
================================================================================

5.1 Each wire shall be marked with its wire identification number at
intervals not exceeding twelve (12) inches and within three (3) inches
of each termination point.

5.2 Wire marking methods shall be per MIL-STD-202, Method 215, using
heat-shrink markers, laser marking, or hot stamp as specified on the
drawing.

5.3 Harness assemblies shall carry a permanent identification tag
affixed near the main breakout point, containing:
    (a) SDC part number and revision
    (b) Supplier part number (if different)
    (c) Serial number or lot number
    (d) Date of manufacture
    (e) Supplier CAGE code

================================================================================
                 6.0 WORKMANSHIP STANDARDS
================================================================================

6.1 All wire harness manufacturing and inspection personnel shall hold
current IPC/WHMA-A-620 certification for the applicable class of
product (Class 3 minimum for SDC flight hardware).

6.2 Workmanship shall meet or exceed IPC/WHMA-A-620 Class 3 criteria
for all visible and measurable characteristics.

6.3 Foreign Object Debris (FOD) prevention measures shall be maintained
throughout all manufacturing operations. FOD inspection shall be
performed and documented prior to harness closeout or packaging.

6.4 Cleanliness requirements per the applicable drawing or SDC
specification shall be verified prior to packaging.

================================================================================
                    7.0 ESD PROTECTION
================================================================================

7.1 All wire harness manufacturing, inspection, testing, storage, and

7.2 ESD-sensitive components and assemblies shall be identified with
appropriate ESD warning labels per ESD ADV11.2.

7.3 The supplier shall maintain a documented ESD control program
including:
    (a) ESD Protected Area (EPA) with verified grounding
    (b) Personnel grounding via wrist straps or heel grounders
    (c) Ionization equipment where required
